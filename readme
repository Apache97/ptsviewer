ABOUT
================================================================================
ptsviewer is a simple OpenGL based viewer for pointclouds stored in a pts file.
Both colored and non colored pointclouds are supported. Multiple clouds can be
loaded and pose estimations for matching can be created.


PTS FILE FORMAT
================================================================================
The pts file format is designed to store pointclouds in a simple, human
readable way. Each point is stored as a couple of values in one line of the pts
file. One line contains at least three values, representing the x-, y- and
z-position of the point in a three-dimensional cartesian coordinate system. If
one line has six or more values, it is assumed that the last three values
represent color information as 8-bit vales in a rgb color space. Additional
information (like remission values, accuracy, ...) may be stored between these
to sets of values. They are ignored.

Example of a pts file containing values for position, color and accuracy:

REQUIRED LIBRARIES
================================================================================

 + OpenGL
 + The OpenGL utility toolkit
 + The OpenGL utility library


Installation on Ubuntu:
> apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev

Installation on Fedora:
> yum install freeglut freeglut-devel


COMPILATION / INSTALLATION
================================================================================

Edit config.mk (probably no changes have to be made) and call for cimpilation:

> make

If you want not only compile it, but install it just call with the appropriate
rights:

> make clean install

CONTROLS
